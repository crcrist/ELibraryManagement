# ELibraryManagement ASP.Net App
## Abstrtact
To gain a deeper understanding of how ASP apps work and how to build them. This project was my first time using Bootstrap, fontawesome, and datatables on a front end application. To support the backend of the application SSMS and C# were used. The application performs basic CRUD operations between the front end of the application and the database.
